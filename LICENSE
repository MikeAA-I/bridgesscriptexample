MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALTERA
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSEE ASSUMES THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE DELIVERABLES AND ANY DESIGN OR PRODUCT IN WHICH THE DELIVERABLES MAY BE USED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LICENSED PRODUCTS. SHOULD THE DELIVERABLES PROVE DEFECTIVE, NEITHER
INTEL NOR ITS AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS ASSUMES LIABILITY FOR ANY COST OF ANY NECESSARY REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. No representation or other affirmation of fact, including but limited to statement regarding
capacity, suitability for use or performance of the Deliverables, whether made by Intel employees or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a warranty for any purpose or give rise to any liability of Intel whatsoever.
By making the Deliverables available, Intel expressly does not recommend, suggest, or require that the
Deliverables be used in combination with any other product not provided by Intel. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to Licensee in full, but shall
be interpreted to apply to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law.
10.0 Limitations of Liability:
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by law:
10.1 In no event shall the aggregate liability of Intel relating to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof
under any legal theory (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), including any liability for any loss or damages
directly or indirectly suffered by Licensee relating to the Deliverables, exceed the lesser of (a) the aggregate
amount of the license fees actually paid by Licensee under this Agreement or (b) One Thousand U.S. Dollars
(USD$1,000).
10.2 IN NO EVENT SHALL INTEL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR
OTHERWISE (a) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, OR LOST OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, (b) FOR
ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGES TO OTHER SOFTWARE OR DATA, OR (c) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE, SUPPORT, OPERATION, OR FAILURE OF THE DELIVERABLES,
WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
LIABILITY AND DAMAGES. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INTEL HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR DUTY TO
DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, OR HOLD LICENSEE HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, SUITS, PROCEEDINGS,
DAMAGES, LOSTS, COSTS AND EXPENSES BASED ON PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS.
10.3 The limitations set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 above shall apply notwithstanding any failure of
essential purpose of any limited remedy stated herein.
10.4 Intel is willing to enter into this Agreement only in consideration of and in reliance upon the provisions
contained herein limiting Intel's exposure to liability. Such provisions constitute an essential part of the
bargain underlying this Agreement and have been reflected in the consideration agreed upon by the Parties.
Both Parties understand and agree that the exclusion of warranties, limitation of liability, and the limitation of
remedies allocate risks between the Parties as authorized under applicable law.
10.5 The Reference Design may contain or be derived from portions of code and documentation provided by
third parties under license to Intel. To the extent that the Deliverables are developed by a third party or
derived from third-party software, no such third party provides any representations or warranties with respect
to the Deliverables, assumes any liability regarding use of the Deliverables, or undertakes to furnish Licensee
any support or information relating to the Deliverables. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Licensee agrees that Intel may disclose Licensee’s identity by name and address, and identify the Deliverables
licensed, to the extent required by agreement with its licensors and partners.
11.0 General:
11.1 Intel shall have a right to audit any Licensee records to confirm Licensee’s compliance with its obligations
under this Agreement. Such audit (a) shall be conducted at Licensee’s facilities at reasonable times upon
reasonable prior written notice as needed to verify Licensee’s compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement, and (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s normal business operations. This Section
11.1 shall survive for one (1) year after expiration or termination of this Agreement.
11.2 Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer this Agreement or the licenses granted, or any rights,
duties, or obligations hereunder, or any Deliverables, whether by operation or law or otherwise, or disclose
any trade secrets or Confidential Information embodied in the Deliverables, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement. Any attempt to sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer without prior written consent of the
other Party any of the rights, duties, or obligations hereunder is void. For the purposes of this Section, a
change in the persons or entities that directly or indirectly control fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity
securities or beneficial or voting interest of Licensee shall be considered an assignment by Licensee and shall
require the other Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
11.3 Licensee shall not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Deliverables, any part thereof, or the
direct product thereof, including Licensed Products, without first obtaining any necessary U.S. or other
governmental licenses and approvals. Licensee hereby gives its assurance to Intel that it will not knowingly,
unless prior authorization is obtained from the appropriate U.S. governmental body, re-export, directly or
indirectly, the Deliverables, any part thereof, or the direct product thereof, to any the countries or nationals
thereof listed in Country Group E:1, as such list may be amended from time to time by the U.S. Department of
Commerce and/or U.S. Treasury Department (which list currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan,
Syria) or (b) to any end user who has been prohibited from participating in the U.S. export transactions by any
federal agency of the U.S. government. Licensee further agrees that no products, propriety data, know-how,
software, or other data or information received from Intel will be directly employed in missile technology,
sensitive nuclear, chemical or biological weapons end uses or by such end users. Licensee understands that
the foregoing obligations are U.S. legal requirements and agree that they shall survive any term or termination
of this Agreement.
11.4 This Agreement is entered into for the benefit of Intel and its licensors and all rights granted to Licensee
and all obligations owed to Intel shall be enforceable by Intel.
11.5 It is expressly agreed that the validity and construction of this Agreement, and performance hereunder,
shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of
the courts in the State of Delaware for the resolution of any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement.
11.6 The Parties hereby agree that the Party who does not prevail with respect to any dispute, claim, or
controversy relating to this Agreement shall pay the costs actually incurred by the prevailing Party, including
any attorneys’ fees.
11.7 No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing signed by a duly authorized
representative of both Parties. The waiver of any breach or default shall not constitute a waiver of any other
right hereunder.
11.8 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.
11.9 The article headings throughout this Agreement are for reference purposes only and the words contained
therein shall not be construed as a substantial part of this Agreement and shall in no way be held to explain,
modify, amplify, or aid in the interpretation, construction, or meaning of the provisions of this Agreement.
11.10 BY USING THE DELIVERABLES OR ANY PART THEREOF, LICENSEE AND INTEL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
LICENSEE AND INTEL HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS
AND CONDITIONS. LICENSEE AND INTEL FURTHER AGREE THAT IT IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE
STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN LICENSEE AND INTEL, WHICH SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR
PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN LICENSEE AND INTEL
RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.
11.11 Licensee agrees (on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries, and other affiliated parties) that neither it nor any of
its subsidiaries or other affiliated parties will, whether during or after the term of this Agreement, institute any
claim or action against Intel, or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of Intel, that is based in whole or in
part on infringement (whether direct or contributory infringement, inducement to infringe, or otherwise) of
any Licensee intellectual property rights in connection with the use, license, offer to license, importing,
exporting, or otherwise disposing of the Deliverables, including any portion, enhancements, modifications, or
derivative works thereof (collectively, “Subject Claims”), or authorize any third party to file any Subject Claims.
This covenant shall extend to any Subject Claims against third-party manufacturers, suppliers, distributors,
resellers, partners, customers, and other licensees of Intel or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of
Intel. This covenant shall apply to and be binding on any assignees, licensees, or other transferees of
Licensee’s intellectual property rights. To the extent that such covenant shall not automatically be binding on
any such assignees, licensees, or other transferees, the assigning party shall cause such covenant to be so
binding and shall indemnify and hold harmless Intel, or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of Intel,
against all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Intel, or any
subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of Intel, that result from or relate to any failure to cause such covenant
to be so binding.
11.13 If Licensee is an agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, the Deliverables are
“commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation”, and pursuant to FAR
12.212 or DFARS 227.7202, and their successors, as applicable, use, reproduction, and disclosure of the
Deliverables are governed by the terms of this Agreement. Contractor/manufacturer is Intel Corporation, 101
